## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more about utilising solely flex, rather than Grid like the previous challenged. I was struggling at first to get the card aligned correctly, until I realised I needed to set a height for the parent container. 

### Continued development

Going foward I would like to refine my skills with CSS over all, particularly by trying to challenge myself with more advanced layouts and designs. Get better at matching sizings of designs. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox or Grid challenge // which would you use to solve these?](https://youtu.be/aKFB5Bjk6KM?si=x37MnxKjDeTMmlCu) - Good video from Kevin Powell which helped me understand when to use Flexbox or Grid
